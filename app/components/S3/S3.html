                            <li>Research has demonstrated that certain people such as some: 
                                <ol>
                                    <li>senior managers in the private and public sectors </li>
                                    <li>individuals in the helping professions (including medical and ancillary professionals) </li>
                                    <li>individuals characterised by a sense of urgency and time-pressures</li>
                                    <li>fail to draw a clear line between their working attitudes and their ‘style of living’ outside work.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Some individuals, who display both a high level of job commitment, and competitive working styles, may also have a tendency to follow the same strategies in their leisure-time; that is, they are highly combative and competitive. </li>  
                            <li>This type of behaviour is known as the ‘spill-over phenomenon’.</li>
                            <li>If you display ‘spill-over phenomenon’ behaviour there is an increased likelihood
                            that you will, in the medium to long term feel: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>a lower psychological and physical health, as well as</li>
                                <li>a general dissatisfaction with living.</li>
                            </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There is evidence that when such people are able to adopt a recreational style which compensates for their hard-driven working styles by embracing pursuits which may be quite the reverse and are less:  
                              <ol>
                                <li>time pressurised and exacting </li>
                                <li>competitive</li>
                                <li>measurements linked to targets and goals</li>
                            </ol>  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They become more relaxed and mellow in character, they are also able to: 
                              <ol>
                                <li>use time more sparingly / selectively, and</li>
                                <li>can be engaged in sitting around apparently ‘doing nothing’ without experiencing frustration or guilt. </li>
                            </ol>  
                            </li>
                            <li>What is often not recognised enough by organisations and people is that taking ‘time out’ is a skilled art!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It is beneficial to your wellness, particularly if you are a person who feels time
                            pressurised, to take ‘time out’ and indeed say:
                              <ol>
                                <li>“I am busy taking time out”</li>
                                <li>“I am busy relaxing”.</li>
                            </ol>  
                            </li>
                            </ul>
